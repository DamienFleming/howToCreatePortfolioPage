Today I'm going to show you how to create your own portfolio page...

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
... One that looks professional and works very fluidly.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Bootstrap themes are very helpful for this and do a lot of the work for you.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You can find and download a theme at startbootstrap.com.

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You'll want to add the files you downloaded to a new, empty git repository so that it looks like this.

6
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Go to your settings and make sure your repository name is [your username].github.io

7
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This will make sure your page goes live at your main github page.

8
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now you can begin to make the website your very own personalized profile.

9
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You can edit the index page to replace content with your own

10
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You can even start changing style sheets to further customize your theme.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Thanks for watching, and goodluck!
